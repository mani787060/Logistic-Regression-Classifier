# Logistic Regression Classifier

This project demonstrates the complete implementation of **Logistic Regression**, one of the most fundamental algorithms used for binary classification in Machine Learning.

The project covers:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling
- Train–test split
- Logistic Regression model building
- Model evaluation metrics

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical features (if any)  
- Scaling numerical variables  
- Splitting data into training & testing  

### 2. Model Training
Logistic Regression is trained using:
- Gradient descent optimization  
- Regularization (optional)  
- Scikit-learn implementation
- Streamlit-learn implementation 

### 3. Model Evaluation
Metrics included:
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score  
- ROC-AUC Curve

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn
